//                      CLICK EVENT
//=====================================================//

1. Get click coordinates
2. Call player.shoot and pass in click coordinates
3. player.shoot creates new Bullet object
4. New 'bullet' class object with new id is added to the DOM
4. Bullet with that id is animated toward click coordinates (rise/run * 2)
5. Determine hit area for creature

On click we get the click coordinates, we then call player.shoot and pass in the coordinates, this method creates a new bullet object,

the bullet sets its coordinates to that of the player, the bullet is then animated towards the click coordinates (rise/run * 2),

then determine hit area for a zombie to be hit.

//                      Zombie Create
//=====================================================//

Zombie spawns at game start, new zombies spawn at different intervals. Create new zombie object
1. Create new zombie object
2. Initialize zombie.move method
3. if object (find by id) has distance < n from player(find by id), initialize zombie.bite on player.health





Q: Should a method be a method if it doesnt effect the object? Or should it just be a function?

My Answer: I use an object method to perform shoot because then i know that the objects are created.
	 i dont have to find the scope of the object that is doing the shooting.

Q: Should objects be declared local or global? - can't call an object in another scope that has been defined locally
